I figured out how the raw sequence is translated into fastq files. 
For the sample I am working with GSE76983, SRR3106546, the left and right
reads are each 75 bp and are different in nature. The left read consists 
of an 8 bp cell barcode, followed by 4 bp UMI, a polyT stretch, and some 
transcript derived bases. The right read is purely transcript derived bases.
This information is from the sample's page on Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). 

Other samples may have difference numbers of base pairs for the cell barcode,
UMI, and polyT. For example, Tata's data consists of a 12 bp cell barcode,
8 bp UMI and a 15-20 bp polyT. 

The Illumina 5' adapter and T7 promoter is used to bind with corresponding
base pairs of the Illumina NextSeq500 machine.

I then proceeded to trim the left read fastq file by using fastq-mcf with
a fasta file consisting of the 96 cell barcodes. Once the cell barcodes
were removed, I used the command line tool 'sed' to remove the first 4 bp
of each read to trim off the UMIs. After removing both the barcodes and UMIs
from the left read, I tried aligning the left and right reads to the genome
using tophat2.

Tophat2 alignment finished in about 35 minutes. This is the result of 
the alignment: 

Left reads:
          Input     :    944758
           Mapped   :      1653 ( 0.2% of input)
            of these:         2 ( 0.1%) have multiple alignments (12 have >1)
Right reads:
          Input     :    944758
           Mapped   :    217636 (23.0% of input)
            of these:         2 ( 0.0%) have multiple alignments (4 have >1)
Unpaired reads:
          Input     :      7613
           Mapped   :      1754 (23.0% of input)
11.7% overall read mapping rate.

Aligned pairs:       402
     of these:         2 ( 0.5%) have multiple alignments
                     399 (99.3%) are discordant alignments
 0.0% concordant pair alignment rate. 

In addition to this, I have tried to write the beginning of a bash script.
